Hi org AppSecAI-TEST,

My name is Cheng Gong (@chenggong03). I am the co-writer of the repositories of 'ebupt-analytics' and 'ebupt-analytics-web', along with Huaxiang Wang (@wanghuaxiang).

The code belongs to a company named EBupt, and the company motions to take down these two repositories. As a result, the repositories 'ebupt-analytics' and 'ebupt-analytics-web' are now deleted under my account. However, the org 'AppSecAI-Test' has forked the two repositories at https://github.com/AppSecAI-TEST/ebupt-analytics and https://github.com/AppSecAI-TEST/ebupt-analytics-web.

We kindly ask you to remove the two repositories mentioned under the org 'AppSecAI-Test', before we sent out a DMCA Takedown Notice to the repo links in the org 'AppSecAI-Test' within 2 days.

Should you wish to discuss this with us further please contact me directly at chenggong0328@gmail.com

Much appreciated,
